# hello-world
explore my first github project.

# 20181226 Tues, Xi'an

today is the birthday of Chiarman Mao, it's a big day. And in this day, I am exploring my git project on archlinux platform.
the issue I have met.
1. Unexpected reschedules of offline CPU0 --- disable BIOS funtions keys, disable hyper-CPU functions.
2. can not login as root at first time after install ---- I think maybe I forgot the root password. 1) so I use the archlinux iso bootable USB disk to boot, 2) and mount the disk to /mnt,  3) and then use command archchroot /mnt, then use passwd to change the root password. 4) add a new user will. 5) then I login as will and su to root. it works.
3. network configration : pacman to install NetworkManager package.
4. to support chinese.
